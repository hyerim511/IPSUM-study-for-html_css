### Customized body & skin product shop
It started from making a made-up company. I made a customized body product shop called "ipsum" because cosmetic has many royalty free resources and it can include some informations of ingredients and booking system for visit shop. 

### Nutral design
The concept of this shop is "make your own body & skin care products" with good ingredients. To make sure the concept, I chose nutral design tone. Primary color is '#40382f', and used '#ece8e3', '#746d65' with light background. 

### Planning for each page
Of course there were requirements for each page, but I wanted to make that each page has each proper function. So I made each page as below:

- Main : Main introduction with videos, including reviews from customers. 
- About : About shop and staffs. Specific information about the shop.
- Process(Table) : Information about processes and ingredients for making product. 
- Booking(Contact) : Forms for booking to make the product, asking questions. 


## Features

I could only use HTML and CSS, but I didn't want it shows flat or boaring. I used some hover effects for avoid that.
