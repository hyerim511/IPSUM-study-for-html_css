## Planning & Design

### Customized Body & Skin Product Shop
It started with creating a fictional company. I created a customized body product shop called "ipsum" because the cosmetic industry has many royalty-free resources and it can include some informations about ingredients and a booking system for visit the shop. 

### Neutral Design
The concept of this shop is "make your own body & skin care products" with good ingredients. To reflect this concept, I chose neutral design tone. The primary color is `#40382f`, and I used `#ece8e3` and `#746d65` with a light background. 

### Planning for Each Page
While there were requirements for each page, I also wanted to ensure that each page had its proper function. So I designed each page as follows:

- Main : Provides an introduction with videos, including customer reviews. 
- About : Contains information about the shop and staff. Provides specific details about the shop.
- Process(Table) : Offers information about the processes and ingredients for making products. 
- Booking(Contact) : Includes forms for booking product-making sessions and asking questions. 


## Features

Although I could only use HTML and CSS, I didn't want the website to appear flat or boring. To avoid that, I implemented some hover effects. 

### Navigation
